Generates server headers which force data to be downloaded to your desktop. Useful with file downloads. The first parameter is the name you want the downloaded file to be named, the second parameter is the file data.

If you set the second parameter to NULL and $filename is an existing, readable file path, then its content will be read instead.

If you set the third parameter to boolean TRUE, then the actual file MIME type (based on the filename extension) will be sent, so that if your browser has a handler for that type - it can use it.
